Durham was himself adopted at birth, along with his (non-biological) two brothers. He has had a wonderful family life. His mother, like Amy had infertility problems (due to toxic exposure as a MASH nurse in the Vietnam war). She simply could not have shown Durham and his brothers more love.

...

Durham's childhood provided him wonderful experiences & skills to impart to a child. He was raised on the grounds of two summer camps, run for over 100 years by his family. He also worked as a hiking, camping, & mountain climbing guide. In our beautiful home-town in Western North Carolina, this provides a nearly infinite opportunity for safe fun & adventure with a child.
