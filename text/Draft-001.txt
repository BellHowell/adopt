Durham was himself adopted at birth, along with his (non-biological) two brothers. He has had a wonderful family life. His mother, like Amy had infertility problems (due to toxic exposure as a MASH nurse in the Vietnam war). She simply could not have shown Durham and his brothers more love.

Durham
Durham's childhood provided him wonderful experiences & skills to impart to a child. He was raised on the grounds of two summer camps, run for over 100 years by his family. He also worked as a hiking, camping, & mountain climbing guide. In our beautiful home-town in Western North Carolina, this provides a nearly infinite opportunity for safe fun & adventure with a child.

Family
We are very fortunate to have quite an extended family. Amy's mom lives in our area, as well as Durham's mom who is a wonderful lady & always has a bright smile. Amy's dad & stepmom live in the mountains of Colorado, where we spend holidays as often as we can. They are both young at heart & have lots of fun with Amy's adopted niece.

Home
Our home is a short walk from downtown Asheville, a lovely little city nestled in a valley in Western North Carolina. We re surrounded by huge national parks with plenty of camping, hiking, rock climbing, & other activities that children & adults enjoy.
