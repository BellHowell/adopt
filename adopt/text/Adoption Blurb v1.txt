First, we are honored that you are even considering us. The thought of becoming parents fills our hearts with joy. Unfortunately having our own has proven impossible, but adopting a child is truly even better!

Adoption has been an integral part of both of our lives.  Durham is adopted himself, his two younger brothers are as well, as is Amy’s brother James and Amy’s niece Finnley.

If given the opportunity to raise a child, we look forward to providing him or her with all of the opportunities to grow emotionally, physically and intellectually. 

Please contact us if you would like to get to know us a bit better.
