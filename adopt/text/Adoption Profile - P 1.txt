First, we are honored that you are taking the time to read our profile. The thought of becoming parents fills our hearts with love and pure joy. We are both fortunate to have been raised by families who value honesty, trust, and unconditional love.

Adoption has been an integral part of both of our lives.  In fact, Durham, his two brothers (Hudson and Burgess), and Amy’s brother James were all adopted at birth, and Amy’s niece Finnley was also adopted before her first birthday.

After many unsuccessful attempts to conceive through fertility treatments, we realized that our path to a family was a different one and embraced the idea of expanding our family through adoption.

If given the opportunity to raise a child, we look forward to providing him or her with all of the opportunities to grow emotionally, physically and intellectually with our full support. Please contact us to get to know us a bit better.
